# Overview
A script created for the Algorithms and Data Structures classes. It generates arrays of random numbers (including their shapes) and compares different sorting methods and puts the results into a spreadsheet.
Since this was one of my first exercises I didn't care too much about code formatting and naming (just get the job done). This is something that I would definitely improve. But if I were to improve I would also use a different programming language today.
